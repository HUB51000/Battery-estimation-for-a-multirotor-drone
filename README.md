# Battery-estimation-for-a-multirotor-drone-using-a-MATLAB-script
Estimates the battery required for a drone to travel between two horizontal points. The initial and final velocity of the drone is 0 m/s. Drag has been taken into consideration. Just type the name of the .m file in the command window to run the code. Any modifications required are to be made in the .m file itself.  
The graphs.m file plots the graph for drag force,velocity and acceleration.
